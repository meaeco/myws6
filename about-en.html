                    <h4>For alterity  and complexity in the object of study and creation</h4>
                    <p>Things don’t exist in a dualistic way, opposed to each other, only meeting from time to time. Things always exist with and through others, the alter. Body and mind aren’t defined as two entities that exist on their sides and then meet in a second time, they exist together, in a unit whole from the beginning. Reality, living individuals (or not) or even experience, aren’t to be understood in duality but in alterity, in the relationships they maintain. If it is the user experience that interests you, it must be understood as a plurality of relationships, direct or indirect events, producing effects on each other in the short, medium and long term. Complexity, which doesn’t mean complicated but means an increase in the relationships to be taken into account, tells us about an object of study that is not limited to itself.

                <div class="space-little">
                    <h4>For the end of the "user-centric" approach</h4>
                    <p>We wanted to focus on the user because we understood that the user is a complex entity to grasp and therefore requires a lot of attention. However, things exist in their relationships, never alone, never pre-existing to each other.  To understand an individual it is not necessary to focus on and isolate him or it, but rather to decentralize, to understand what makes one to act, why and how in a networked action.</p>

                <div class="space-little">
                    <h4>For the end of the "project”</h4>
                    <p>I am aware that the project notion is everywhere in our western society, it is even a key word for the designer. However, the notion that divides time into a before and an after doesn’t seem to me to be adequate for the designer. It is not a question of thinking, projecting or anticipating what the future will be and then, putting oneself into action in a second step. The designer puts himself into action immediately in order to practice and learn, because knowledge doesn’t come without practice and vice versa. Also, it is unfortunate to think of products, services or any other devices that don’t evolve after the designer's passage, after the end of the project, it will make them obsolete sooner or later, like waste behind the designer's steps.</p>

                    <h4>For pedagogy</h4>
                    <p>For individuals to no longer be passive but active actors in the sense of well-informed and thoughtful. The user is always an actor but he rarely becomes the subject of his own experiences, he tends to become passive in his action, always there but actor of his erasure. Lack of reflexivity, for example, not knowing what my own actions imply any upstream and downstream; what happens to make my Nutella jar fill up (upstream)? What happens when I use my smartphone (present)? What happens when I throw my Macdo on the ground (downstream)?
                    <br/>I am for empowering individuals by giving them explanations (of what happens before, during, after) and choices. To do so, I like to question attention. How can we give explanations in a society where our attention is easily stealthy or limited? How can we do it according to the possibilities of time and space?</p>
