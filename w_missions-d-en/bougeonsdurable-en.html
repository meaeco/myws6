            <p>In the Val de Garonne agglomeration, pollution is very high, almost as high as the Bordeaux agglomeration, whereas the Val de Garonne has 4 times less inhabitants. The individual car, during communal and inter-communal journeys, is a major contributor to this pollution, however, according to our study, it seems indispensable for residents who are very attached to their comfort, certainly, but who also have poor alternatives for necessary daily journeys, regional planning and our contemporary lifestyles. To propose more sustainable mobility, our survey supported the view that the solution wouldn’t be found in the technique but in the pedagogy of the proposal.</p>

            <p>Balancing between an agglomeration that is afraid to commit to a new system and citizens attached to their cars, we propose to open the debate between public policy and citizens so that a common awareness is established: it is important that each party becomes aware of the objective and subjective realities of each in greater depth, even us on the design side, in order to find a solution that corresponds to each party in order to be sustainable.</p>

            <h4>Fiction in design?</h4>
            <p>Design fiction creates a fiction (plausible, probable, desirable, preferable, embarrassing, detestable) relating a present time, a near future or a distant future, in order to question its spectators (users, decision-makers, engineers, etc.), to invite them to reflect, to open them up to debate, especially about what we wish for the future, in order to invest the decisions and actions to be carried out in the present for this desirable future.</p>
            <p>Therefore, the users of fiction are not those of the invented story but the spectators who watch it.<span class="txt-color"> The fiction designer must convince the spectators that his story is plausible so that they will engage in a reflection about it.</span></p>
            <p>The prototypes and devices (objects, services, etc.) of fiction are not those of traditional design, intended to be commercialized. They are there to support and encourage fiction.</p>

            <p>Part 1: First, we propose to engage the debate and provoke reflection through a fiction on mobility by evoking the passage of an ecological and restrictive law on automobiles.</p>

            <p>Part 2: Then, in a second step, we will bounce back on the fiction to invite people to exchange and co-construct via workshops regrouping citizens and representatives of the agglomeration.

            <p>We realized several communication supports as if the author was the government since our fiction is a law to come: a video with "social networks" format (inspired by the channel Brut), a facebook page, explanatory leaflets, posters, the site of the ministry which makes it possible to carry out a simulation for the vignette of its vehicle (<a href="http://master.designbordeaux.fr/projets/vga-mobilite/prototypes/groupe3-sinergie/"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">simulation here</a>) and finally, we realized the vignettes to be distributed so that the whole seems real.</p>

            <p>Part 2.</p>
            <p>After several weeks dedicated to the communication of the fiction and its anchoring in the reality of the citizens, we move on to the workshops. The workshop phase takes place in several stages: return to the fiction, debate, problematization, ideation and prototyping.</p>
            <p>The debate is important both at the design and pedagogical level, it allows designers, elected officials and citizens to listen, to probe the needs and obstacles of each party but also to reveal possible opportunities for action. As for problematization, it allows to identify the real frictions, to go beyond the first intentions which are often illusory (example: I need a drill to attach this frame. I need to attach this frame.) and to agree on them in order to orient the design towards solid foundations. Finally, the purpose of ideation and prototyping isn’t to come up with a solution to be taken back as it is. Ideating and prototyping with the public is also to make them responsible for the possibilities (psychological, technical, etc.) and the choices made.</p>

        <div class="">
           <h4>The existing</h4>
           <p>We first analyzed existing services, in terms of mobility but also in terms of activity in general. We looked for mobility actors. We carried out cartographic analyses, urban planning analyses and analyses of travel flows, particularly according to objectives. Finally, we carried out a communication analysis about the sustainable mobility services already in place (public transportation, sustainable because limiting the use of the car alone).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="row justify-content-center space-img-trv">

        </div>

        <div class="space-little">
            <p>We underlined the fact that the area is almost as polluted as the Bordeaux agglomeration, even though it has 4 times fewer inhabitants!
            <br/>We pointed out an aging and very rural territory, agricultural and with a few factories. This means long distances to travel and decentralized needs. The Val de Garonne agglomeration, with Marmande as its city center, has a "heart of the city" policy since its center is abandoned, shops and small craftsmen are disappearing for activities that are decentralized to commercial areas with big international brands.</p>

            <p>Few mobility services are offered in comparison with the daily travel requirements: whether public transit (limited offer in terms of frequency and space) or development (little or no park-and-ride facilities, few or no dedicated bicycle routes, etc.). However, this is a common occurrence in France in view of the resources available to urban areas and the number of inhabitants.</p>

            <p>We will see later on that in any case, it is not the lack of availability and development that reduces the possibilities of sustainable mobility but also the habits that have a lot to do with it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="">
            <h4>Uses</h4>
            <p>Thanks to the various statistics, observations and guerrilla interviews that we conducted, we transcribed user paths, verbal feedbacks, highlighted the positive and negative points of the frictions at stake and noticed that the inhabitants were very attached to their cars! 83% of trips are made by private car, but with the interviews we understood how this habit/dependence worked.</p>

            <p>In a rural area, where the distances between activities are far apart, the car becomes an indispensable tool and presents itself as very practical and, it must be said, very comfortable.</p>

            <p>Some inhabitants aren’t aware of the buses near their homes. It happened several times during the interviews that it is us who teach them. Some of them have a bus stop nearby, they know the line and the schedules but they never use it and prefer the car. This is also the case of a student we met, who never takes the bus and constantly asks his parents to make the trips for him.</p>

            <p>Indeed, why take the bus knowing that the stops can be 5 or 15 minutes away on foot, that this same journey is interrupted by the ascents and descents of other passengers, that they are rarely direct, that the schedules are not chosen, that the frequency of passage is light? And above all, for a large number of communes, it is necessary to reserve at least 24 hours in advance. The individual car is thus unavoidable for many people.</p>

           <p>How can we think of a sustainable, flexible and user-friendly transport service offer taking into account the rural environment of VGA to limit the use of the private car?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="space-little">
            <h4>Ideation</h4>
            <p>In order to feed our imagination, we began by analyzing existing rural mobility in other cities. We carried out brainstormings in which we introduced a verbal feedbacks (collected during the interviews) drawn randomly. With each feedbacks drawn, we invented a new story, a new service proposal.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="">
            <h4>Scriptwriting</h4>
            <p>We have imagined three scenarios that respond to our problem. We made storyboards to communicate about our hypotheses.</p>
            <p>1. The first hypothesis aims at improving the already existing services.</p>
            <p>2. The second hypothesis takes into account citizens' attachment to their cars but seeks to reduce individual car use and reinvest in the centers of neglected cities. To achieve this, we have devised a carpooling service depending on the activity at the time of the trip (work, leisure, etc.) where partnerships with shopkeepers and craftsmen are forged in order to stimulate the use of the carpooling service and the return to the city center.</p>
            <p>3. The third proposal mixes design fiction and citizen workshops. This is the choice made by the decision-makers of the agglomeration and presented at the beginning of this article. Due to the various constraints of this project, the choice to explore this or that scenario was unfortunately not made according to user feedback, but according to customer feedback and public policy.</p>
