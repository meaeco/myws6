            <p>This application is aimed for people who are already familiar with personal data and want to know more about the handling of their personal data, but also for people who are more novice about this phenomenon and want to understand what it is and how it affects them. Thus, it is possible to use the application in "normal" or "pedagogical" mode.</p>

            <p>In the settings you can decide to classify more or less sensitive data. Depending on the sensitivity set, you may receive notifications that a data collection has taken place, or just decide to highlight the corresponding bubble on the timeline.</p>
            <p>Another view mode other than "timeline" is available. This second mode allows to compare the quality of the collected data and its quantity (type of data and number of recoveries about it).</p>

        <h3 class="space-middle">Phase 0: setting the mission’s frame</h3>

        <div class="space-little">
            <p>At the Metropolitan area, design makes its entrance little by little. The framing of the mission proves to be essential in any project, but here, it also allows us to show what the designer is doing and how, in a place where we still know little about him. It was a question of defining the instructions, the final and intermediate deliverables, the project team and the stakeholders, the macro specifications, the constraints: deadlines, capacities (human, hardware, software, space), cost, quality, scope. And finally, risks, methodology and planning.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="space-little">
            <h4>Risque</h4>
            <p>The treatment of personal data is a technical solution. The personal data is given here without a live/human context. It is as if we had a key and we had to find its lock (the human context in which to insert it). Therefore, be careful not to force our way into a lock, a context, it would be a failure.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="space-middle">Phase 1: from personal data to knowledge-power relationships</h3>

        <div class="space-little">
            <h4>The existing internal analysis</h4>
            <p>I first read up on the public policies of the Lyon Metropolitan Area, and then those related to my department. I went through the reading of numerous reports, articles and guides written by Grand Lyon about the occupations, objectives and strategies concerning personal data, even just the data itself, in order to adequately invest the project ecosystem and the dynamics already present.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="space-little">
            <h4>The existing external analysis </h4>
            <p>In order to discover personal data, I have gathered the definitions that concern it (scientific and/or legal discourse) but also the laws, its treatment according to organisms, its transformations and the effects it produces, the actors that surround it (directly and indirectly) and above all the discourses and practices about it whether official or unofficial, harmonious or contradictory.</p>
            <p>Through this work of discovery, I was able to begin to establish different cartographies about personal data in order to grasp the actors (human or non-human) who are in direct or indirect relation with it, as well as the effects they produce together. Mappings allow us to understand the thing, its context and its stakes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="row justify-content-center space-img-trv">

            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="space-little">
            <h4>Challenge</h4>
            <p>Thanks to internal analysis, we were able to identify that of the Lyon Metropolitan Area presents itself as an innovative institution, sensitive to its citizens and close to them, pointing to an imbalance between those who produce the data and those who manipulate it. Consequently, the "reappropriation of personal data" is clearly presented as a strategy occupying GrandLyon's professionals, especially those associated with the "Self Data" project component already engaged in the service.</p>
            <p>However, we had to go further and question the expression: What is reappropriation? Is it really possible? How can we engage in reappropriation?</p>
            <p>Indeed, the possibilities of reappropriation (which means regaining ownership) are very limited and controversial. The speeches of the Lyon Metropolitan Area evoke the "recuperation of power", the "taking in hand", the "control", the "security", which means the return to ownership. However, reappropriation seems an ambitious word to evoke an entity that is so manipulated and finally becomes almost elusive, because when personal data is solicited, it no longer belongs to the person who produced it. Difficult to control it entirely, to have total power over it, the producers of personal data are often dispossessed of it. So, to what extent can we then speak of reappropriation?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="">
            <h4>The meetings</h4>
            <p>In order to learn a little more, strategic monitoring is not enough, the field research must feed the first research and correct or complete the maps.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="">
            <p><strong>Experts speeches:</strong>I met with specialists at La Métropole, technical experts (data scientist, software architect), and personal data processing managers (Chief Data Officer).</p>
            <p><strong>Audience speeches:</strong> I also began meeting with the public, to question them as a "producer" about their experience with personal data.</p>
            <p><strong>Guerrilla interviews (unstructured):</strong>It was in the street, equipped with a sign, post-it notes and a single question ("What is personal data?"). I observed the impressions, tried to understand how the experience of personal data is lived at present, and then I made room for the other's views.</p>
            <p><strong>Unscheduled interviews (unstructured):</strong>Many words were also recovered by approaching the subject on a daily basis, during short filmed interviews.</p>

           <p>Attention: for each interview or observation, it was important to take into account the limits such as cognitive risk factors, environmental constraints, external influences etc. Especially as the interviews were not prepared, however, in design, you shouldn’t wait for the ideal situation to go into the field, but be aware of the limits, and then, iterate as much as possible. Thus, taking the temperature while being aware of these and its limits, also makes it easier to return to the field.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="row justify-content-center space-img-trv">
            <div class="col-md-7">
                <img class="" src="../images/im_missions/smd/smd6.png" alt="suivre mes données personnelles" title="suivre mes données personnelles"/>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="">
            <h4>Observations</h4>
            <p><strong>Participants:</strong> I started by questioning and digging into my own practices. How do I navigate the web? With what? What is the status of my application settings? Do I know the conditions of data use on these same applications? What do I know about the laws concerning my data? How can I remember my passwords? How many external companies have my email? Where is my information kept at home? etc.</p>
            <p><strong>Non-participants:</strong> I have also observed all the people around me. For example, when I passed behind their screens and they were consulting a site, they validated the cookies authorization without reading them. I also (with permission) searched the application settings of my friends and family. I noticed the reactions to phone spam, the delivery of contact information when making purchases, the scanning of loyalty cards. I was able to observe people in their experience of their personal data via the virtual but also in the non-virtual; For example, where are the important documents in a house? How do people get rid of their important documents?</p>
            <p><strong>The anecdote</strong> that marked me the most, was that of a colleague at work, tearing a piece of paper with her contact information on it into a thousand pieces before throwing it in the trash, even though in the settings of her applications, nothing was managed in a thoughtful way, she told me that she never read the conditions around the use of her cookies.</p>

            <h4>UI analysis</h4>
            <p>I have browsed many sites, many applications, data visualizations, spaces, products and services. I've read a lot of terms of use, searched through cookies, clicked through a lot of pop-ups, settings and options. I analyzed ergonomics, cognitive and physical accessibility, effects through interviews and tests (for example, I refused or accepted all the parameters of my own mobile).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="">
            <h4>Set up an in-depth interview</h4>
            <p>These first meetings and observations made it possible to establish lines of reflection to be deepened. I was able to prepare an interview guide for future meetings.</p>
            <p>The points to be questioned were : The knowledge on the functioning of personal data, the opinions on the current functioning and exploitation of personal data, the personal exploitation of one's data, the future wills on the subject, the definition of reality in the relationship between virtual and non-virtual, and finally, the understanding and intelligibility of personal data.</p>
            <p>In addition to the questions, we used a scale for the interviewee to position himself on his knowledge of personal data before and after the interview. We also made conclusions between "knowledge perceived by the interviewee" and "real knowledge of the interviewee" (we had to make a return of these conclusions with the interviewees, in order not to make caricatures and categories as most researchers like to do).</p>
            <p>Given the subject is still abstract for the general public, we used animal photos to view people's perceptions.</p>

        <div class="space-little">
            <h4>More meetings</h4>
            <p>I was able to begin the guerrilla interviews in greater depth. I started with the usual introductory question, but this time followed by a directed interview depending on how much time the person could devote to me. I used the same guide for more conventional, closed interviews.</p>
            <p>I was also able to conduct free group interviews during a workshop on personal data.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="">
            <h4>The "why" matrix</h4>
            <p>After the various meetings, a lot of information needed to be put in order to understand the situation. I used the "5 whys" technique to get a clearer picture, but I went further than the usual 5 whys.</p>

            <h4>Attitudes towards personal data</h4>
            <p>As the meetings progressed, there was a need to freeze the words in order to make them more understandable. We set out attitudes or profiles in relation to personal data in order to evoke the different experiences lived. Be careful, these attitudes exist for information purposes and don’t necessarily evoke a person exactly. This is the danger of personas and caricatures.</p>

            <h4>Ideation</h4>
            <p>It is a service of intelligibility of the personal data that I decide to invest. First of all, I believe that is through knowledge that we can, in the first instance, regain power over it. Following our investigations, I understand that the personal data is little or badly known in view of the number of people who produce it (...everyone). Not everyone realizes that the virtual practice gives real information.</p>
            <p>Also, the Lyon Metropolitan Area wants to offer services so that citizens can use their personal data, and for this, it is important that they already know that it exists and what it is. If people aren’t aware of their personal data and do not understand it, how can they exploit it? Thus, raising awareness and understanding is important for the reappropriation strategy and related projects already in place.</p>

        <div class="">
            <h4>Business model canvas </h4>
            <p>We define the business model more precisely, we start to determine the "value proposition" and "target" axes. The canvas changes and becomes more precise as the field research progresses and allows us to know at a glance where we are and where we need to go. It is a good visualization tool to develop a solid strategy and communicate about it.</p>

            <p>It is important to put the observers' accounts into the hands of the observed (cf. Latour Bruno, Changer de société; Refaire de la sociologie, Paris, La Découverte, 2005). We have thought of a platform for exchange about personal data and the project. We imagined explanations, feedback (ecosystem, attitudes towards data, political constraints, etc.), spaces for comments, votes or questionnaires.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, it was important for us to involve the public in the creation that concerns them, especially since we are here in public policy. We are talking about citizen participation rather than user participation.</p>

            <p>I used 2D, from paper sketch to wireframe. Going through the formatting allowed me to generate new ideas by questioning colors evoking the day and then the night, it is the notion of time that challenged me. Time and the relationship to daily life have become central elements in the process of understanding personal data. It has become crucial to make people understand personal data by going through their daily life, from waking up to going to bed, in each action realized, via a timeline at first.</p>

            <h4>Guerrilla test</h4>
            <p>Every prototype made or just drawn has to come out of the office! Feedbacks are needed to move forward. They must be given to see, to touch. So that's what I did, even for the sketches, without necessarily going down to the street but already circulating in the departments of La Métropole, from floor to floor, from office to office, asking for simple opinions and not necessarily with an expert eye.</p>
            <p>However, once the interactive prototypes were available, testing the application was a must. Phone in my hands, Figma in the bag, I wandered around the city, questioning people.</p>

            <h4>Prototyping, testing, prototyping, testing and so on</h4>
            <p>From the general look to the buttons position, each implementation and practice questions the prototype, the user experience but also the business model canvas. For example, during the tests, it emerged for some a difficulty of understanding or use. Thus, it was necessary to define more precisely the target we wanted to address and since this target isn’t necessarily an expert in digital technologies, it was important to think the application with more pedagogy: an avatar that accompanies the user and an informative section were born.</p>

        <div class="">
            <h4>User paths</h4>
            <p>How to deploy the application? How to draw the public’s attention on it? How to insert it into everyday life? This is where the target makes sense. Did we want to approach people who are completely novices or just interested people who don't take the plunge?
            </p>

            <p>Several paths were then envisaged, particularly in relation to the use of digital services in the Lyon metropolitan area.</p>
