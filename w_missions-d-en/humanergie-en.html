                <h4>Fiction in design?</h4>
                <p>Design fiction is a branch of design that deals with the conception of fiction (plausible, probable, desirable, preferable, awkward, detestable) relating a present time, a near future or a distant future, in order to question its spectators (users, decision-makers, engineers, etc.), to invite them to reflect, to open them up to debate, especially about what we wish for the future, in order to invest the decisions and actions to be carried out in the present for this desirable future.</p>
                <p>onsequently, the users of fiction are not those of the invented story but the spectators who watch it.<span class="txt-color"> The fiction designer must convince the spectators that his story is plausible so that they will engage in a reflection about it.</span></p>
                <p>The prototypes and devices (objects, services, etc.) of fiction aren’t those of traditional design, intended to be commercialized. They are there to support and encourage fiction.</p>

            <p>What if we create mobile from the immobile? From the active with what seems a priori inactive? Energy from something that no longer has as much energy as it once did?</p>
            <p>The last century was one of an unprecedented demographic explosion. Since in addition to increasing, the world's population is aging, Humanergie is turning a problem into a resource. While some might tell you that the elderly slow down our dynamics, that they consume our energy, our contributions, our time and that they are more and more numerous to do so, Humanergie wants to fight against this stigmatization; don't call them "old people" anymore, they are our light!</p>

            <h4>Opening for discussion</h4>
            <p>Today in our world, and particularly in the West, we wonder about: population growth, life expectancy that is getting longer, the aging population that is increasing, over-consumption in developed countries and pollution that heavily dominates the environment. Through the concept of mobility, to our turn, we want to question these different themes. We consider that mobility characterizes trips, and even more so all movements, whether relative, absolute, visible or invisible. We would say that mobility has a double component, spatial and social. We assume that individual physical mobility participates in the social, economic, cultural and relational mobility of an individual in the West. Indeed, in order to move in the virtual space of the social, relative movements, in space from a place, are necessary. Physical mobility is a right, a right to have a family, to work, to create a network, to travel, etc., especially in a liberal society. Even more than taking a place in a nomenclature of socio-professional categories, mobility makes it possible to "appropriate a resource in order to make use of it. The idea of a resource - which refers more to an offer than to an order - allows to account for flexible phenomena" (Alain Bourdin, Mobilities and the program of sociology. 2005). Individuals are therefore mobile in different ways. If physical mobility sustains "resources" (see Alain Bourdin) or "capital" (see Pierre Bourdieu) at the level of individuals, it also sustains at the level of State. Individual mobility and the economic mobility of a country are closely linked.</p>

            <p>In this context, what happens to less mobile individuals? What values do they bring to the community? Our fiction questions the value of immobility and its treatment in a society that wants to be increasingly mobile.</p>

        <h2 class="space-big">Process</h2>

        <div class="space-little">
            <h4>The notion of mobility: between current events and a systemic approach</h4>
            <p>We had to question a phenomenon that we practice every day, mobility. A lot of brainstorming and mapping allowed us to re-enlighten this notion that touches so many aspects of our daily lives, aspects that are both different and yet well connected. For example, mobility questions our movements, our urban planning, our consumption, our resources, etc. It is not because mobility is an exceptional notion that affects all areas, but because our analysis is systemic in view of the objects of study, which are always complex, which means with a large number of relationships to be taken into account.</p>

            <p>Our common interest in the equality and sustainability of our systems of co-existence has led us to question mobility by crossing ecology, physical movements, activities and social representations.</p>


            <p>With all the controversies in retirement home or EHPAD, it is the theme of the elderly that we have chosen. First of all, because we believe that there is a problem in the current treatment of our ancestors, a problem that is symptomatic of the general functioning of our societies and which, moreover, in the course of our investigation, is at the crossroads of the relationship between physical and social mobility.</p>

            <p>Finally, since everyone has or has had parents or grandparents and everyone will in turn become elderly, this subject allows us to anchor ourselves in the daily reality of our spectators in order to invite reflection.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="space-little">
            <h4>Meetings and observations</h4>
            <p>We asked the seniors to tell us about their daily lives. Seniors at home but also seniors in retirement homes. We also questioned a few caregivers.</p>

            <p>Following this, the axes that we wanted to support are: the relationship between a decrease in physical mobility and a decrease in social mobility, the very reduced social experience of the elderly (few visits, few trip, impression of no longer existing or of no longer "being of use"), the relationship between nostalgia and forgetfulness, the abuse of services for the elderly due to a lack of means.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="space-little">
            <h4>Challenge</h4>
            <p>Two challenges then arose: how to talk about physical mobility but also social mobility, and then how to make something, that doesn’t yet exist, conceivable in the eyes of the spectators.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="space-little">
            <h4>Worldbuilding</h4>
            <p>We had to define our context, our fictional environment. To do this, a lot of sketches, trendy boards, but also a lot of writing to work on the narration.</p>
            <p>We had to create a world, a story. To prototype our story, we imagined a brochure, a presentation leaflet, as we see it today. With today's codes, we started talking about a company that doesn't yet exist. Using current codes allows us to anchor our fiction in reality, the brochure was our first diegetic object.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="space-little">
            <h4>Diegetic objects</h4>
            <p>We constructed the story at the same time in the objects of our fiction, it is by working them in parallel that each was able to nourish the other. Prototyping our diegetic objects allowed us to realize the effects they produced, did they seem real or incongruous?</p>
            <p>For example, for the ante-mortem offer of our fictitious service, we had imagined an object that enters the brain to capture people's memories or integrate them again. Our first prototype revealed to us that it resembled an object of torture, which wasn’t at all the intended purpose, so we were able to make the object less impressive and more common, close to the necklace.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="row justify-content-center space-img-trv">
            <div class="col-md-4">

            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="space-little">
            <h4>Identity and visual communication</h4>
            <p>Obviously we were going to have to communicate about our fiction; posters, a video, an exhibition... all this with a delicate subject: the recycling of human beings in their life and in their death.</p>
            <p>We chose an anime aesthetics first because we had little time, no actors at hand, especially no old actors and no one with good acting skills. Also, our fiction takes place in 2100, we needed a city map, architecture, but it was impossible to film the landscapes of 2019. Finally, the cartoon style allowed us to approach this delicate subject without scaring the viewer too much.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="">
            <h4>DIY and exhibitions</h4>
            <p>Now that we have the story, how do we make the fiction appear real? What experiment can we put in place? This is the format of the exhibition that has been proposed to us for both events.</p>
            <p>Then, we imagined our exhibition as a commercial stand. As in any trade show or exhibition, we had our own dedicated angle, with our identity and our "salesmen on site". Equipped with lights, posters, flyers, advertising screens, t-shirt with company logo, we put ourselves in the shoes of sales representatives to sell our service as we would have done for any real service.</p>
            <p>In order to immerse the spectator in the fiction, we created an interactive terminal where it was possible, thanks to a test we developed, to tell people which ante and post mortem services were adapted to them according to their daily life (food, activity etc.). In this way, the spectator himself becomes the subject of our fiction, allowing us to touch him personally in order to engage in a reflection.</p>
            <p>The anecdote that made us proud is that of a few people who asked us when the service would be available. Our fiction had thus become real.</p>
